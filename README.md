## Visualization 1
In the final project, we aim to investigate the trends of drug overdose death rates in the United States from 1999 to 2018 and compare the drug overdose death rates across different demographic factors, including race, gender, and age. Our question could be “What are the trends in drug overdose death rates in the United States from 1999 to 2018 between different genders?” We want to understand which demographic groups are most susceptible to high death rates due to drug overdose. We will focus on the overall drug overdose death rather than specific drug types. The dataset we plan to use is "Drug overdose death rates, by drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin: United States, selected years 1999–2018." from the website https://data.gov/. Through analysis, this dataset can provide valuable insights into the demographic patterns and disparities associated with drug overdose fatalities, and we may identify significant variations in drug overdose mortality rates among diverse populations. So, this dataset can help us answer our identified question. 


Here is the link to our chosen dataset:https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-overdose-death-rates-by-drug-type-sex-age-race-and-hispanic-origin-united-states-3f72f. You can also find the Excel file of our dataset in the repository.


The issue of drug overdose death rates in the United States is a critical and multifaceted concern that has garnered increasing attention over the past few decades. In our first visualization, our goal is to analyze the trends in drug overdose death rates in the US between 1999 and 2018, with a particular emphasis on gender differences. The plot indicates that males consistently experienced higher death rates than females. Moreover, the overall death rate for both genders has shown a continuous increase each year. Before 2014, the gender gap in death rates was nearly identical. However, from 2014 to 2017, there was a significant surge in the male death rate, leading to a notable widening of the gap between the sexes.

## Part 3
In order to analyze the problem of Drug overdose death rate changed over age group and race in the U.S. from year 1999 to 2018. We do the data cleaning.
The dataset initially includes variables such as Drug type, Death rate type, Demographic category, Demographic label, Year, and Estimate rate. To ensure relevance, I chose to filter the "Drug type" to include only “All drug overdose deaths” which represents all drug overdoses, not the specific drug overdose.  The second visualization examines the variations in death rates across different age groups, so we filter the Demographic category to include only Age. The third visualization examines the racial distribution of deaths resulting from drug use during that year. Because the data set only has a demographic category that shows Sex and race, we recalculated the death rate as race type and created a new dataset “Drug_overdose_death_rate_by_race.csv” uploaded to GitHub.

In our second visualization, our objective is to examine the variations in death rates across different age groups in the United States. There are a total of nine age groups under consideration. The plotted data reveals a notable surge in death rates among individuals aged 25-34, surpassing that of the 45-54 age group until approximately 2016, and intersecting that of the 35-44 age group. Based on the graph, we hypothesize that there is an increasing trend of drug usage among young and middle-aged adults (25-44 years old) started in 2012. Consequently, this rise in drug use may be contributing to a higher number of deaths within this particular age demographic. Drug death rates for Under 15 and 75 haven't changed much in those 20 years or so.

With previous plots, we realized that the changes in 2016 were significant. Consequently, we aimed to delve into a specific examination of the racial distribution of deaths resulting from drug use during that year. The bar plot illustrates that whites exhibit the highest number of drug overdose deaths, whereas Asians or Pacific Islanders represent the lowest. The disparities between American Indians or Alaska Natives and Blacks or African Americans are relatively modest. It's worth noting that these variations might be influenced by the demographic composition of the United States, where whites constitute approximately 60% of the population.
