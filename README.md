# stat451-final-project


In the final project, we aim to investigate the trends of drug overdose death rates in the United States from 1999 to 2018 and compare the drug overdose death rates across different demographic factors, including race, gender, and age. Our question could be “What are the trends in drug overdose death rates in the United States from 1999 to 2018 between different genders?” We want to understand which demographic groups are most susceptible to high death rates due to drug overdose. We will focus on the overall drug overdose death rather than specific drug types. The dataset we plan to use is "Drug overdose death rates, by drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin: United States, selected years 1999–2018." from the website https://data.gov/. Through analysis, this dataset can provide valuable insights into the demographic patterns and disparities associated with drug overdose fatalities, and we may identify significant variations in drug overdose mortality rates among diverse populations. So, this dataset can help us answer our identified question. 


Here is the link to our chosen dataset:https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-overdose-death-rates-by-drug-type-sex-age-race-and-hispanic-origin-united-states-3f72f. You can also find the Excel file of our dataset in the repository.


The issue of drug overdose death rates in the United States is a critical and multifaceted concern that has garnered increasing attention over the past few decades. In our first visualization, our goal is to analyze the trends in drug overdose death rates in the US between 1999 and 2018, with a particular emphasis on gender differences. The plot indicates that males consistently experienced higher death rates than females. Moreover, the overall death rate for both genders has shown a continuous increase each year. Before 2014, the gender gap in death rates was nearly identical. However, from 2014 to 2017, there was a significant surge in the male death rate, leading to a notable widening of the gap between the sexes.
